## Overview

The Company API is designed to offer a seamless experience for managing companies, providing key features that make it a valuable asset for various applications:

1. **List of Companies:** Retrieve a comprehensive list of companies registered in the system, facilitating easy access to essential company information.

2. **User Authentication:** Ensure secure access to the API by authenticating users through a well-defined login system. This feature enhances the overall security of the API, protecting sensitive company data.

3. **Create New Companies:** Allow privileged users, particularly administrators, to create new companies, thereby enabling the dynamic expansion of the company database.

This API serves as a robust foundation for more complex systems, offering a flexible and scalable solution for company data management.

## Getting Started

To kickstart your journey with the Company API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/company-api.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Continue with the installation of the dependencies.

3. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **API Configuration:**

    Before running the API, you may need to configure environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

    ```env
    PORT=8000
    ```

    Adjust the `PORT` value as needed.

5. **Start the Server:**

    Start the API server with the configured environment variables:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

 ### 1. `GET /companies`

```

## Testing

The Company API includes a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure its functionality and reliability. You can run these tests using the following command:

```bash
npx jest
```
### Test Cases Overview

- **Empty Array Handling (GET /companies):**
  - *Description:* Verifies that the API returns a 200 OK response with an empty object when there are no companies.
  - *Test Command:* `it('GET /companies returns a 200 ok response with an empty object if no companies are found', async () => {...});`

- **Missing Name or Location (POST /createcompany):**
  - *Description:* Validates that the API returns a 400 Bad Request response if the name or location is missing when creating a company.
  - *Test Command:* `it('POST /createcompany returns a 400 Bad Request response if name or location is missing', async () => {...});`

- **Non-Admin User Creation (POST /createcompany):**
  - *Description:* Ensures that non-admin users receive a 401 Unauthorized response when attempting to create a company.
  - *Test Command:* `it('POST /createcompany returns a 401 Unauthorized response for non-admin users', async () => {...});`

- **Successful Company Retrieval (GET /companies):**
  - *Description:* Validates that the API returns a 200 OK response with the correct list of companies.
  - *Test Command:* `it('GET /companies returns a 200 ok response if companies are found', async () => {...});`

- **User Authentication (POST /auth):**
  - *Description:* Tests user authentication by checking if a correct username and password result in a 202 Accepted response.
  - *Test Command:* `it('POST /auth to login a user with a correct username and password', async () => {...});`

- **Unauthorized User Access (POST /auth):**
  - *Description:* Verifies that an unauthorized user is denied access when providing an incorrect password.
  - *Test Command:* `it('POST /auth with incorrect password', async () => {...});`


## Project Structure 

Understanding the structure of the project is essential for developers aiming to contribute or customize the API. Key components include:

- **server.js:** The main server file.
- **routes/:** Houses route handlers for different endpoints.
- **models/:** Contains data models for users, companies, etc.
- **tests/:** Includes test cases for the API.

In the `routes/` directory, you'll find route handlers that define the behavior for each API endpoint. The `models/` directory holds data models representing entities like users and companies, facilitating data management within the application. The `tests/` directory includes test cases to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API.

Understanding these components will provide developers with insights into the organization and functionality of the Company API.

## Dependencies 

The Company API relies on several dependencies to deliver its functionality. Key dependencies include:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): A powerful web application framework for Node.js.
- [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): Middleware to parse JSON requests effectively.
- [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest): A library for testing HTTP assertions, ensuring the reliability of the API.

These dependencies are crucial for the core functionality and testing procedures of the Company API. Express provides a robust framework for building web applications, while Body-parser aids in parsing JSON requests efficiently. Supertest is instrumental in testing HTTP assertions, ensuring the API's reliability and correctness.
